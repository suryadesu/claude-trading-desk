========
The contract between a strategy, a decision layer, and the engine.

A strategy's only job is to propose candidates and describe the situation.
It never decides whether to trade — that belongs to a Decider — and it never
executes — that belongs to the engine. Keeping those three apart is what lets
us run the same strategy against rules, hand-written gates, and a model, and know
the only thing that changed was the decision layer.
