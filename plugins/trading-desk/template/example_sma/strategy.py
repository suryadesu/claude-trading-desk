"""
strategy.py  --  the example strategy: a moving-average crossover on SPY.

This exists so the pipeline runs end to end the moment you clone the kit. It is
deliberately one of the most-published rules in trading, which means it is
almost certainly not an edge, and that is the point: you should watch the
harness report an honest "no edge" before you trust it to report a yes.

Replace this file with your own logic. The contract the rest of the harness
needs from a strategy object is small:

  feature_cols                 the columns the model and the gates may read
  prepare(df)   -> DataFrame   add indicators and a `signal` column
  snapshot(...)  -> Snapshot   describe one candidate in words and numbers
  gates()       -> [Gate]      hand-written filters: the control arm
  model_prompt() -> ModelPrompt  what to ask the model (Laya)

`prepare` must produce these columns, because the engine reads them directly:

  signal              'long' | 'short' | ''
  stop, target        absolute prices for the proposed trade
  minutes_from_open   used for the end-of-day flatten

The one rule that matters more than any other in here: every column must be
computable from data available AT that bar. A single indicator that peeks one bar
ahead will produce a beautiful equity curve and a worthless strategy.
